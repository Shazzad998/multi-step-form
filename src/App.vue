              stated. Indexes are not available for direct investment. A
              professional advisor should be consulted before undertaking any
              strategy or implementing any specific advice. Always consult an

              Investing involves risk. Rates of return are not guaranteed unless

              are dependent on the financial strength and claims-paying ability

              various restrictions, limitations, or fees, which can vary
              depending on the issuing insurance company. Annuities have
              limitations and are not appropriate for all circumstances or

              Lifetime income may be available on certain products through an
              optional rider at no cost or for an additional cost, depending on
              the specific product and contract. Taking withdrawals prior to
              turning age 59 Â½ may result in tax penalty fees in addition to
              ordinary income taxes. Withdrawals from annuities may trigger
              charges or reduce the contract value and death benefit. Insurance
              products are not insured by any federal government agency and may
              lose value.
